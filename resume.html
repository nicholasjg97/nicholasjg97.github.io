                    <h2>Development Projects</h2>

                    <h3>Movies Application</h3>
                    <p>This was a paired project both my partner and I are proud of making and continue to build. It's a movie application that allows the user to add, edit, and delete movies from a server. We used HTML JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.</p>

                    <h3>Weather Map API Project</h3>
                    <p>Single-handedly built a fully responsive HTML user interface that displays daily 5 day weather forecasts using Javascript requests to several third-party API services. A single search gathers data from the user input and displays data based on the corresponding coordinates.</p>

                    <h3>Ad-Lister Project</h3>
                    <p>Project built with a team of five. In this paired programming project, we used HTML and Java EE. Users can view & post ads in this web application that contains multiple functionality features such as edit, delete and search posts. Users also have the capability to edit their username & email.</p>
